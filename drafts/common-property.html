        <p>A prestigious private university tried to implement a pretty cool program on campus. The student government had observed that many students needed to walk far distances to go to the next class in a short amount of time. The student government decided it was a good investment to spend money on bikes that anyone in the community could use. The bikes purchased did not last very long. By the end of the school year, the majority of the bikes were in very bad condition or were missing. Students had no incentive to treat common property as their own. There were no consequences, no accountability. The university has since replaced the damaged bikes and requires students to check a bike in and out each day with their student credentials.</p>
<p>When it isn't your company, you arent going to take as good care of it. When there are other people who could bring it inside when it rains or inflate the tires when they're low, then you feel less incentive to be the one doing the work. When other people are involved, it is easier to think someone else should do it or that you don't need to do it. Maybe it's &quot;not in your job description.&quot; You'd never hear an entrepreneur say that expression. The job description for an entrepreneur is 'whatever needs to be done and more'</p>
