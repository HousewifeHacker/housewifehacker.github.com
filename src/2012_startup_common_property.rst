A prestigious private university tried to implement a pretty cool program on \
campus. The student government had observed that many students needed to \
walk far distances to go to the next class in a short amount of time. The \
student government decided it was a good investment to spend money on bikes \
that anyone in the community could use. The bikes purchased did not last very \
long. By the end of the school year, the majority of the bikes were in very \
bad condition or were missing. Students had no incentive to treat common \
property as their own. There were no consequences, no accountability. \
The university has since replaced the damaged bikes and requires students \
to check a bike in and out each day with their student credentials. 

When it isn't your company, you arent going to take as good care of it. When \
there are other people who could bring it inside when it rains or inflate the \
tires when they're low, then you feel less incentive to be the one doing \
the work. When other people are involved, it is easier to think someone else \
should do it or that you don't need to do it. Maybe it's "not in your job \
description." You'd never hear an entrepreneur say that expression. \
The job description for an entrepreneur is 'whatever needs to be done and more'
