Today, about two months after the round four applications for StartUp \
Chile (www.startupchile.org) closed, the accepted 100 teams were announced. \
Our team was one of the chosen to recieve 20.000.000 chilean pesos \
($40,000 US) over a sixth month time period to start our business in Chile. \
The money is not tied to any exchange of equity. However, the government does \
not simply hand over cash either. The program requires us to spend our own \
money, getting reimbursed up to 90% of each expense for a total of $40,000 \
over the six month period. We also have to volunteer our time for various \
causes within the community that directly benefits the local population. \
Most people in the program earn credit by speaking about entrepreneurship. \
Our friend George Cadena, founder and CEO of StudioSnaps, taught an \
entrepreneurship course at local universities and has continued to teach and \
mentor beyond the duration of his program requirements. We will probably earn \
our credit by teaching programming and putting on events with our event \
planning software. Most of the StartUp Chile events are currently using \
Welcu, which is like Eventbrite but one third the quality. They're fine for \
night club events or a small pool party, but that's about it. Their software \
is very limited, a little ugly, and pretty plagued with programming bugs. \
Their goal is to be acquired, and it shows. We aim to manage the entire event \
planning process, from communicating with clients, contracting vendors, \
organizing speakers, collecting registrations, and analyzing reports. We LOVE \
the event planning business. Our passion, experience, and quality should \
make us a serious threat in Chile, South America, and the rest of the world.
