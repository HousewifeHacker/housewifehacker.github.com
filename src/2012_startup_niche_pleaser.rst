Can't Please Everyone

None of our products will ever become the next viral hit for everyone and \
their grandmother like Facebook, Gmail, Pandora (once upon a time) etc... \
We've adapted a different approach to development. We want to help people \
in a narrow industry or niche. The people we choose to help are people we \
know and understand well. We take the time to know who they are, what they \
want, and what they aren't really good at.
