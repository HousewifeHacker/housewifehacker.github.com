Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

Probably the most popular, I mean cult inspiring, computer programming book \
of all time. This book created a movement circa the year 2000. All the major \
universities that prided themselves on producing technical talent adopted this \
textbook into their curriculum. It began as a Scheme and Intro to Programming \
course at MIT. Now, many passionate programmers own a copy to reread at their \
leisure. Although Scheme isn't very useful anymore, lessons from this book can \
be applied to other languages, including python. If you aren't infatuated with \
math and theorems, the least you should do is read the first chapter free at \
http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html . Actually, the whole \
book is available for free online. I still prefer physical books however. \
Unplugging a little each day is healthy. I recommend buying a copy to take to \
the park, or wherever. If you do love math, then you will love this book. \
At the very least, my physical copy is a great conversation starter among \
programmers. Guys don't expect a mom to be reading SICP I guess.
