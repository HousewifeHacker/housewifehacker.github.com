The Practice of Programming

Disclaimer: This book does not have any python examples. But even before I \
began dabbling in C, I believe this book made me a better programmer. I \
recommend this book for the intermediate programmer who knows how to code, \
but may not be very good at coding with others. Someone who can write code \
that works, but their code is not pretty to look at later for debugging, \
learning, or changing code. Someone fresh out of college who needs to work \
on code with other developers for perhaps the first time. After reading this, \
I went back through all my old posts and changed spacing and naming (wasn't \
a big deal because I moved my blog to my new domain from blogger). I now \
run pep8 against my python code. My programs are easier to read and follow \
logically. My variables make sense and are easy to remember. I feel that I \
have surpassed one of the beginner hurdles to becoming a good developer.
