Day in the Life As A Remote Programmer

I get asked 2 questions frequently that I'd like to handle at the same time:
1. What is the day of a programmer like?, and 2. What was it like going remote?
I've only worked on one team in the office, while I've worked remote \
on 3 teams and from a scrappy startup home office (living with cofounders) \
once. Here's what my typical day was in \
the office and out of the office in California:

 - Wake up at 5am to prepare kids' lunches, let dog pee, bathe children, get myself ready

 - Drive 1 hour in the Prius to our paid parking spot near Caltrain

 - Spend 30 minutes walking that includes taking kids to daycare, goodbye kiss to my husband who is getting on \
 Caltrain to ride 2 more stops, and walking to my office

 - Arrive in office around 8:30. 1 other employee is there. She is usually on the phone with \
 sales and support employees located in other US timezones to determine pain points with customers. \
   If she is not on the phone, we chat a little about tv shows, babies, husbands,... life.

 - Check to see if I have any emails or messages needing a response. Respond. It was most likely \
 the CEO in Texas so he's at his computer/phone already. Possibly have a chat on Google Hangouts \
   including me sending him screenshots of ideas or progress.

 - Review GitHub Pull Requests. If any of my PRs are approved, merge them and update my tickets
 with details of the build number, tests effected, changes made, and links to the test runs. \
   If any PRs request small changes, make them. If anyone asked questions, answer them. If anyone \
 requested my review, review.

 - Review my tickets. Figure out if there are any tickets that need more clarification. Collect \
 any questions I need to ask, sketch out some UI ideas, read the code where I think changes will \
   need to be implemented, run the deploy tests that are reported a failing, or try to manually \
 reproduce the bug that was reported.

 - 11am: CTO, VPE, 1 scientific computing engineer, and 1 tester enter the office. The entire \
 product team of a company with annual $10M revenue is in office. If it's Monday, we have a
   meeting around the CTO's desk. I don't bring up my questions unless the build is broken. \
 I do mention if there are team members I need to meet with. If it's not a Monday, I send direct \
   messages to people I want to talk to. They can respond whenever they want, because I have lots \
 of other things I can work on.

 - 12:30: The office mates go out for lunch. I'm on a budget because 2 6 figure salaries isn't enough \
 to pay rent an hour away, have 2 kids in daycare, and save money for a house. Their families are \
   smaller than mine and I'm the youngest in the office with no family in the area. I eat quickly at my computer and do some yoga \
 to stretch while the office is empty. The dog walker is walking my puppy for $20 a walk because I \
   wont be home in time to avoid a potty accident.

 - Code, test, manually verify fixes look good and work correctly. Spend a couple hours deep in thought, \
 in the zone, hyper focused on exactly what I should be working on.

 - 4:30pm: Run out the door to pick up my kids from daycare that closes at 5. Meet my husband at the \
 car at 5:15 or notice a text message that he'll be ubering home late (7pm-11pm).

 - 6:30pm Arrive home after driving. My back hurts. I hate my commute. I sing to my babies and wish \
 I had $2M cash to buy a house in Palo Alto (because it has to be cash in such a competitive market). \
   Time to cook dinner, walk the dog, turn on cartoons for the kids

 - 8pm Kids are in bed after a family walk and bed time stories.

 - 9pm I'm almost in bed, exhausted. Remember I didnt send in my I Did This email summary. \
 Spend 5 minutes on it. Read the ones done by my coworkers to see if they need me the next day.


Now I could show you what I do as work from home, but it's not much different. The difference is the obstacles. \
Working remote, I don't have 2 hours in the car every day. I replaced the $3600/month daycare expense with $1000/month, \
by moving away from the office. I have a mortgage of $2,000/month instead of paying $3500/month to rent. I spend less \
time crying, less time wishing I had family in California or went to Stanford (because it's a frickin mafia there). I \
can code on the evenings and weekends on personal projects or take courses without my eyeballs and motivation dying. \
My husband spent the past 3 years working on a startup with one year of that being without a salary. My home utility \
bills did go up from always being home. I get out of the house more now than I used to get out of the office. I \
travel (preferably quarterly) to meetup with coworkers for team building, workshops, and major version kickoffs (planning).\
Meetings are done over video. After we were acquired by a company with nicer offices, even the people in the office would \
join the call from different meeting rooms (not together). I exercise more, usually next to my computer. I listen to my \
music with speakers, not headphones. When we gained team members in Europe, I had more working time overlap with them \
than the California people did. The Github repo contributions demonstrate that I am dominating people who have been with \
the company longer than I have and have continued to work from California offices.

But remote working is adding new obstacles. Finding a new job is 100 times harder when anyone in the world can apply \
for that position. Expected compensation is half of what it would be in California because of cost of living comparison \
calculators. It's even more challenging if you leave the country like I did. Cost of living calculators don't consider \
differences in taxes, public education school system success/failure that could results in expenses for tutoring or private school, \
poor condition of the roads increasing my transportation expenses (could apply to parts of the US too), \
higher than the tool's estimation of a  cost of a home because it meets US standards of quality and safety, etc... \
Which brings me to another challenge of remote work, \
which is relating and understanding other parts of the world. My life is different, my holidays are different dates, my \
expenses are not easily translated to California. If I pick up a phone during a meeting, I'm answering it in Spanish (and \
hanging up on them if it's not urgent and about my children). I'm not Catholic, but schools are closed on Catholic holidays \
so my kids may peek in on a video call those days. Despite those challenges, I know I'm healthier, happier, and more \
effective as a remote worker. I was already an introvert and too burned out to be much fun. Trust me, you'd prefer to \
have me remote too.
