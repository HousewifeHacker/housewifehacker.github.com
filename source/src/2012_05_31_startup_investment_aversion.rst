Investment Aversion

We have many well developed ideas for businesses that we could be launching \
as startups. One of our ideas is especially low risk, has a high earnings \
potential, is related to our CTO's work experience, and is in a fun and \
exciting industry. Naturally, we've decided to focus our energy on that \
product, so that we can earn enough money to be able to work on other \
projects later. That idea is our conference management system.

One of the reasons our conference management system is so well thought out \
is that we have not been shy to discuss our ideas with other entrepreneurs. \
We don't fear our idea being stolen because we are confident that no other \
person or team could complete our product better than ourselves. We've also \
analyzed the competition and learned from related industries. A couple \
times while we've discussed the software with someone who has achieved a high \
level of financial success, they have expressed interest in investing. Many \
young people with a startup would give up a large portion of their company for \
some cash, but not us. 

Giving equity is messy and time consuming for a couple reasons. First, you \
have to invest the time to know your potential investor's goals. If your \
investor wants the company to change or go in a different direction, it's \
kind of hard to tell them no after they've given you money. You need to \
have compatible goals and motivation to work well with an investor. Second, \
you have to determine if the investor truly adds value to your project. \
Sure, cash is value. But other than cash, can they offer connections? \
Do they have experience in your industry? Do they want to be on the board, \
involved in company decisions as a mentor? Third, you have to get everything \
in writing and pay for lawyers and accountants to organize ownership and \
vesting schedule contracts. You may spend two or three weeks ironing out \
details with a potential investor, only for them to change their minds the \
day before signing the contract. 

Then once you go through the laborous process of securing your investor, \
the politics starts. Be prepared to explain every business expense, ask \
permission for every new hire, and justify any changes to the business plan. \
Instead of just making changes to your product to attract more business, \
everything is dependent on metrics. If a change improved revenue, you better \
be able to prove it. If you disagree with an idea or a hire suggested by \
your investor, you need to have spreadsheets, dollar signs, and a presentation \
prepared to be convincing. 

Startups without investment do face a lot of risk and challenges. But as a \
reward for being truly bootstrapped, they are incredibly mobile and dynamic. \
Smaller, lighter objects can change directions faster than objects with \
greater mass. Small teams operating out of a shared apartment can adapt \
much quicker than a large organization that requires board meetings and weekly \
email updates. An investor may just become an extra phone call or hoop to \
jump through before acting on a necessary innovation or pivot. A good \
investor is like love. It will happen when you aren't actively looking for it, \
it will be harmoneous, and you would never want to be without them. I would \
not be averse to a truly beneficial investor, but we're not eager to find our \
angel just yet. I'd rather be cautious of involving other people in our \
plans and keep the equity to ourselves.
