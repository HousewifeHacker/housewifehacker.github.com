Building a game is a fun way to learn and practice some of the initial learning of React. A game always
has state, user interactions, and changes to render. It's also interesting to reset a game, because
you may end up realizing why pure functions and/or immutability libraries and tools are actually a big
deal. I'm also able to save routing, fetching, and redux lessons for later, becuase I don't need them
for my game. Another shortcut is using CodePen, so that I can use JSX and ES6 without setting up
Webpack or Babel configs.
